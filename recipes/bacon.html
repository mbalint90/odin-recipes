The perfect bacon sandwich starts here
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <il>6 rashers streaky bacon, or 3 rashers back bacon</il>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Lay the bacon in a single layer in the base of an air fryer 
        be sure the layers aren't overlapping.<br> 
        The size of the air fryer basket will determine how many rashers you
        can cook at one time.</li>

    <li>Set the air fryer to 200C and cook streaky bacon rashers for 6-10 mins
        -just-cooked bacon will take 6 mins, <br> but crispier bacon will take 9-10 mins.
        Cook back bacon rashers for 4-8 mins, depending on your preference.<br> 
        If you are cooking in batches, remember that the second batch will usually 
        be quicker as the air fryer has heated up.</li>
    <li>Remove the bacon using tongs and put on kitchen paper to drain before serving.</li>
</ol>
